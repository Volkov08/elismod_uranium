# Minecraft Radioisotopes Mod

This mod adds radioactive materials to the game and a few fun things to do with them.
*Uranium*, *plutonium*, a *nuclear fission reactor* and *nukes* are currently implemented.
We are working on a *radiation system* operating with doses and 
there will be possibilities to protect yourself.

**NOTE:** This is an ongoing project in a pretty stable state, 
and we are working on it in our limited free time.

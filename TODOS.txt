Shortterm goals:
- Push (empty) lead_battery from fuel slot into output/hopper (currently not implemented for vanilla furnaces)
- Improve explosion visuals (e.g. custom renderer)
- Special radiation during explosions

Longterm goals:
- Fusion Reactor (multiblock?)
- Antimatter (Tenebrium Ore) usage -> e.g. additional nuke and powerful sword
